/**
 * Simple interface for objects that are sources for an {@link InputStream}.

 * <p>This is the base interface for Spring's more extensive {@link Resource} interface.
 *
 * <p>For single-use streams, {@link InputStreamResource} can be used for any
 * given {@code InputStream}. Spring's {@link ByteArrayResource} or any
 * file-based {@code Resource} implementation can be used as a concrete
 * instance, allowing one to read the underlying content stream multiple times.
 * This makes this interface useful as an abstract content source for mail
 * attachments, for example.

	 * creating mail attachments. For such a use case, it is <i>required</i>
	 * that each {@code getInputStream()} call returns a fresh stream.

	 * 返回一个用于潜在资源内容的输入流。
	 * 预期每次调用创建一个刷新流。
	 * 当你考虑如Java邮件的应用编程接口时，这个要求相当重要，即，当创建邮件附加物时需要能多次读流。
	 * 对于这样的用例，这就要求每次获取输入流方法调用返回刷新流。
